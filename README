A chatroom which is written in JAVA.

We have two version of the server. The EfficientServer is very fast and we haven't found any bugs.

The TcpServer still has some problems, I wrote it just for practicing my coding algorithm skills.

My plan is to add an database and create a javaweb for the client.
